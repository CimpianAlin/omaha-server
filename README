Simple Google Omaha server implementation.
+ added Sparkle (mac) feed management
Copyright (C) 2014 Crystalnix <contacts@crystalnix.com>

Developed for Python 2.6.6.
May work on newer versions of Python.

Depends on:
    twistd python framework
    pyOpenSSL
    mysql-python

Launch:
    $ twistd -ny server.tac
    Then go to https://localhost:8083/service/admin to use
    the administration interface.

Comments:
    You should add your privkey.pem file and server_chain.pem
    file to the cert directory. Change the line in chained_ssl.py
    file if you wish to use a single certificate for SSL,
    not a certificate chain file:

    FROM: ctx.use_certificate_chain_file(self.certificateChainFileName)
    TO: ctx.use_certificate_file(self.certificateChainFileName)
